BoilerPlate is intended to be used as a template for future projects, 
providing built-in logging and various Window properties that can be set
via getter/setter methods (i.e, Icon, Title, Width, Height, SizeToContent, 
ResizeMode, etc.).

The BoilerPlate project should NOT be modified to add content.  The 
BoilerPlate project should be forked as a new project and modified from
there.
